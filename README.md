# CodeStorage

Used by <https://appedit.solsort.com>.

Simple code storage, where you can save/fetch the source of an app, given an unique id. Limited to small files, - and keeps track of ip+time to avoid misuse.

It is deployed via Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/solsort/code-storage>. Data volume: /usr/src/app/data
